# The Indie GDD: A Living Blueprint

> **Philosophy:** This document is not a novel; it's a blueprint. It's a *living document* meant to be updated, referenced, and changed as the game evolves. Its purpose is to:
> 1.  **Maintain a Clear Vision:** Keep everyone on the same page.
> 2.  **Control Scope:** Clearly define what's IN and what's OUT.
> 3.  **Guide Development:** Provide the "why" and "what" for the "how" of daily tasks.
>
> *Keep it concise. Use bullet points, images, and links. If a section isn't relevant to your game, delete it.*

## Section 1: The Core (Your Game's Elevator Pitch)

> This is the most important section. If you can't explain this clearly, the game's vision is not focused enough.

**1.1. Game Title:** *Working Title is fine.*
**1.2. High Concept:** *A single, compelling sentence. Format: [Game] is a [Genre] about [Core Action/Theme] for [Target Audience].*
> **Example:** "Sunstone Survivors" is a top-down roguelike arena shooter about collecting magical gems to create overpowered builds for players who love fast-paced action.

**1.3. Genre:** *e.g., Puzzle Platformer, Narrative Adventure, 2D Action Roguelike.*
**1.4. Target Audience:** *Be specific. Not just "everyone." e.g., "Fans of Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing," "Hardcore platformer players who like Celeste and Super Meat Boy."*
**1.5. Platform(s):** *PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, Mobile, etc. This decision impacts controls, scope, and performance.*
**1.6. Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** *What makes your game special? Why should a player care? This is your secret sauce.*
> **Example:** The core mechanic is 'gravity-shifting,' allowing the player to walk on walls and ceilings to solve puzzles.

**1.7. Core Gameplay Loop:** *Draw or describe the minute-to-minute cycle of what the player does. This is the heart of your game.*
> **Example:** Explore -> Fight Enemies -> Collect Loot -> Upgrade Character -> Return to Explore (with more power).

**1.8. Mood & Tone:** *Use 3-5 keywords. e.g., "Mysterious, Melancholy, Hopeful." or "Chaotic, Humorous, Fast-Paced." Attach a mood board link.*

## Section 2: Gameplay Mechanics

> This section details *how* the game works. Be specific and avoid vague language like "fun."

### 2.1. Player Character
- **Abilities:** What can the player do? (Jump, Shoot, Dash, Talk, Interact, Build).
- **Controls:** Basic control scheme (e.g., WASD to move, Mouse to aim, LMB to shoot).
- **Progression:** How does the player get stronger? (New abilities, stat upgrades, new equipment).

### 2.2. Core Mechanics
- **Mechanic 1 (e.g., Combat):** Describe it in detail. How is damage calculated? What are the enemy types? What is the player's feedback (screen shake, sound effects)?
- **Mechanic 2 (e.g., Crafting):** What are the recipes? How are materials gathered? What is the UI flow?
- **Mechanic 3 (e.g., Dialogue):** Is it choice-based? How is it presented?

### 2.3. Key Systems
- **AI:** How do enemies behave? (Aggressive, passive, patrol patterns).
- **Economy:** How does the player earn and spend currency?
- **Save System:** How, when, and where does the game save?

### 2.4. Win & Lose Conditions
- **Win:** How does the player complete the game/level? (Defeat the final boss, reach the end of the map, solve the final puzzle).
- **Lose:** How does the player fail? (Health reaches zero, timer runs out, fail a critical objective).

## Section 3: Game World & Content

> This is the "what" and "where" of your game.

### 3.1. World & Level Design
- **Art Style:** Describe the visual style. (Pixel Art, Low-Poly 3D, Hand-drawn 2D). Link to reference images.
- **Level Structure:** How are levels structured? (Open world, linear progression, hub-and-spoke, procedural generation).
- **Key Locations:** List and briefly describe major areas.

### 3.2. Story & Characters (If applicable)
- **Story Synopsis:** A short paragraph summarizing the main plot.
- **Main Characters:** Briefly describe the protagonist, antagonist, and key supporting characters. Focus on their role in the game.

### 3.3. Asset List (A "Living" Checklist)
- **Art:** Player sprites, enemy sprites, environment tiles, UI elements, VFX.
- **Sound:** Footsteps, jump sounds, attack sounds, UI clicks.
- **Music:** List needed music tracks (e.g., "Main Menu Theme," "Level 1 Theme," "Boss Battle").

## Section 4: The Roadmap & Milestones (The Power Section)

> This is where you turn your design into a plan. It's your most powerful tool for shipping a game.

### 4.1. Pillar Features (The "Must-Haves")
> List the 3-5 core features that define your game. If these aren't fun, the game fails. **Everything else is secondary.**
> **Example:**
> 1. Gravity-shifting mechanic.
> 2. Challenging platforming puzzles.
> 3. Minimalist story discovery.

### 4.2. Stretch Goals (The "Nice-to-Haves")
> List features that would be cool but are not essential for the 1.0 launch. These can be added post-launch or if time permits.
> **Example:**
> 1. New game+ mode.
> 2. Boss rush mode.
> 3. Alternate character skins.

### 4.3. Milestones & Deliverables
> Break your project into clear, measurable phases. A milestone is complete when its deliverables are DONE.

| Milestone | Goal | Key Deliverables (What you can see/play) | Estimated Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Prototype** | Prove the Core Loop is fun. | - Player character can move and jump.<br>- One basic enemy exists.<br>- Core mechanic (e.g., gravity-shift) works. | 1-2 Weeks |
| **Phase 2: Vertical Slice**| Build one small, polished level that represents the final game. | - One complete, playable level.<br>- Final art style for assets in that level.<br>- Basic sound effects and music.<br>- Core UI (health, score). | 1-2 Months |
| **Phase 3: Alpha** | All content is in the game, but it's buggy and unpolished. | - All levels are playable (blockouts are fine).<br>- All enemies and mechanics are implemented.<br>- Save system works. | 2-4 Months |
| **Phase 4: Beta** | The game is feature-complete and the focus is on bug fixing and polish. | - No major bugs that block progression.<br>- All final assets are integrated.<br>- Game is balanced. | 1-2 Months |
| **Phase 5: Gold** | The game is ready for release. | - All known bugs are fixed.<br>- Game is optimized for target platform.<br>- Store page is ready. | 2-4 Weeks |

### 4.4. Team & Roles
> *Who is responsible for what?*
> - [Name]: Lead Developer, Gameplay Programming
> - [Name]: Art & Animation
> - [Name]: Sound Design, Music

### 4.5. Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity, Unreal, Godot, GameMaker, etc.
- **Key Tools:** Aseprite, Blender, FMOD, GitHub, Trello, etc.

## Section 5: Appendix

> A place for important reference materials.

### 5.1. Controls Scheme (Detailed)
> A full list of all inputs and their functions.
